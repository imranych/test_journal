              <h3>My new journey as a bootcamp student.</h3>
              <div class="post__intro">
                After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer
                Career Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get
                expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet
                like-minded peers.

              <h5>How I stay committed to learning</h5>
              <p>
                I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend
                hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects
                using what I learned or work new techniques into existing
                projects. While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to
                share what I was learning and most things about my journey with
                the world.
              </p>
              <h5>How I got started</h5>
              <p>
                I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I
                would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning
                session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned
                but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own
                words. That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized
                that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn
                and stay motivated.
